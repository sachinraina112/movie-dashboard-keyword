# Movie Database API Data Dashboard 

This is a flask app that visualizes data from the movie database API. Data is
pulled directly from the API and then visualized using Plotly. The application 
takes an user input in form of a keyword and gives top relevant movies as per
different parameters like rating, popularity etc.

This is a project I have done for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. 

## Getting Started 

This flask app can be used as a template for visualizing your own data. Use
the template to enhance your professional portfolio. 

## Prerequisites

To install the flask app, you need:
- python3
- python packages in the requirements.txt file
 
 Install the packages with
``` 
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installing

On a MacOS/linux system, installation is easy. Open a terminal, and go into 
the directory with the flask app files. Run `python worldbank.py` in the terminal.
